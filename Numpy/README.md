# Numpy
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental, open-source library in Python primarily used for numerical computing. Its core feature is the ndarray object, which represents a homogeneous, N-dimensional array capable of storing and efficiently manipulating large datasets of the same data type.
## Key features and uses of NumPy:
- Multidimensional Arrays (ndarray): NumPy's ndarray is significantly faster and more memory-efficient than standard Python lists for numerical operations, especially with large datasets. This is due to its contiguous memory storage and optimized C implementations.
- Mathematical Operations: It provides a vast collection of high-level mathematical functions for performing operations on arrays, including element-wise calculations, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation.
- Data Manipulation: NumPy offers extensive functionalities for manipulating array shapes, sorting, selecting elements, and performing input/output operations.
- Foundation for Scientific Computing: NumPy forms the basis for many other scientific computing and machine learning libraries in Python, such as SciPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.
Applications: It is widely used in various fields requiring heavy computation, including data science, machine learning, engineering, and scientific research.

## Why use NumPy over Python lists?
NumPy arrays are generally preferred over Python lists for numerical data when:
- Performance is crucial: NumPy's optimized operations offer significant speed advantages for large datasets.
- Homogeneous data is involved: NumPy excels at handling arrays where all elements are of the same data type.
- Advanced mathematical operations are required: NumPy provides a rich set of functions tailored for numerical computations.
